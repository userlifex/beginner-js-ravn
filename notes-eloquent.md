At the begining the programming language was awful to understand, write and read, beacuse, in the other things it was typed by 0s and 1s, even if we take this code to english we found difuculties to read it 

That's why the language matters because a language that is easy to understand and give us some content that allows be more productive with our work >?

JS [1995] to Netscape navigator browser

ECMAScript === JavaScript

ES4 was abandoned in 2008
ES5 [2009]
ES6 [2015] that version give us some of the improvements planned for version 4


DATA TYPES

a binding[variable] not only save a value for ever also we set as const 


# FUNCTIONS

- a "return" without an expresion after it will cause the function return undefind, same as functions that don't have a return keyword at all
- before 2015 only functions create scopes and variables define with _var_ are visible in the scope of that function or in a global scope if there is no function 

The set of bindings visible inside a block is determined by the place of that
block in the program text. Each local scope can also see all the local scopes that
contain it, and all scopes can see the global scope. This approach to binding
visibility is called lexical scoping
